3)Database Server

Stores user data, application records, certificate templates, and issued certificates.

Ensures data integrity and security.

4)Certificate Generation Module

Merges user data with certificate templates.

Generates certificates in PDF format with unique identifiers.

5)Digital Signature Integration

Applies digital signatures to certificates to authenticate and prevent tampering.

Utilizes Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for secure signing.

6)Notification System

Sends email and SMS notifications to users regarding application status and certificate issuance.

7)Security Layer

Implements SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission.

Utilizes CAPTCHA for bot prevention.

Applies role-based access control (RBAC) for system security.
