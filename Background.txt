Background
Government certificates are official documents that validate various aspects of an individual's identity, status, or eligibility. Historically, certificate issuance was a manual process managed by local administrative bodies, often resulting in delays, inefficiencies, and lack of transparency. As part of e-governance initiatives, many governments worldwide have started adopting digital systems to automate these services. However, challenges such as limited infrastructure, lack of integration across departments, and user accessibility continue to persist. Therefore, a dedicated, secure, and scalable system that incorporates automation, digitization, and citizen convenience is crucial for modern governance.
